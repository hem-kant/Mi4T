	/// <p>
	/// Manages the overall system <em>Configuration</em>.  In this regard,
	/// <em>Configuration</em> is defined as any data that needs to be
	/// externalized from the code that processes the business rules configured
	/// for the system.  In this sense, <em>Configuration</em> can be either
	/// small pieces of information required for the working of the application,
	/// such as, Database Connection strings, external machine addresses, etc.;
	/// or, it can be externalized content required at runtime, such as, error
	/// messages, etc.
	/// </p>
	/// <p>
	/// Although the .NET framework provides Application Configuration files to
	/// allow developers to store <em>Configuration</em> information, there are a
	/// few problems with the default .NET Configuration framework.  These
	/// include:
	/// <br /><br />
	/// <li><strong>Inability to change <em>Configuration</em> information without
	/// recompilation</strong> - This is because the Application Configuration
	/// file is embedded in the executable assembly for the application.
	/// Changing anything in the Configuration file requires a complete rebuild
	/// of the assembly.</li>
	/// <li><strong>Inability to update <em>Configuration</em> information at
	/// runtime</strong> - As the default .NET Configuration file is embedded
	/// inside an assembly that is loaded when the application first starts, it
	/// is not possible to change the Configuration information while the
	/// application is running.  A new version of the compiled assembly with new
	/// (or updated) <em>Configuration</em> information can take effect only after
	/// the application has been stopped and restarted.</li>
	/// <li><strong>Inability to test components independently</strong> - 
	/// Components that are developed as independent assemblies cannot be tested
	/// in isolation until they are plugged into a .NET application.  This is
	/// because .NET Class Libraries are not allowed to have their own
	/// Configuration files.  This is not only quite expensive from an effort
	/// stand-point but also quite cumbersome.  For example, if someone is developing
	/// a Class Library for reading error messages at runtime, the classes being
	/// developed cannot be unit tested until the Class Library has been plugged into
	/// an executable assembly.  All the code written as part of an executable
	/// assembly just for the purposes of unit testing some other code is simply
	/// throw-away and hence a waste of effort.</li>
	/// </p>
	/// <p>
	/// This class is part of a generic framework that allows externalizing
	/// <em>Configuration</em> information and storing it on the file system as
	/// XML files.  The only requirement to use this framework is to provide it
	/// with a root path where all external <em>Configuration</em> files will be
	/// stored.
	/// </p>
	/// <p>
	/// It is intended that the entire <em>Configuration</em> for an application
	/// be accessible from a central location.  This is required in order to
	/// ensure that any changes to the <em>Configuration</em> can be monitored
	/// centrally and dependent objects be notified of the changes.  For this reason,
	/// this class has been implemented as a <strong>Singleton</strong>.
	/// </p>
	/// <p>
	/// There are only two pieces of information that the <em>Configuration framework
	/// </em> needs before it can start reading XML files and providing access to the
	/// information inside them.  These are:
	/// <br /><br />
	/// <ol>
	/// <li><strong>Configuration root path: </strong>This should be a path on a
	/// Windows file system where all XML configuration files will be stored.  The
	/// files can be further organized within the base folder into sub-folders and it
	/// is not required for all the files to stored directly under the base folder
	/// itself.  It is also required that the Windows account under which the .NET
	/// application is running to have at least read-access to the base folder and
	/// all folders and files under it.  The root path information is mandatory for
	/// the framework to function as failing this the framework will not be able to
	/// figure out where the configuration files are located.
	/// </li>
	/// <li><strong>Configuration file extension: </strong>All configuration files
	/// should have the same extension for the framework to pick them up.  This is an
	/// optional piece of information and if not supplied is assumed to be ".xml".
	/// </li>
	/// </ol>
	/// </p>
	/// <p>
	/// In order to overcome the shortcomings of the default .NET Configuration
	/// system, the current framework provides multiple ways of passing the starting
	/// information to it.  The base location of configuration files and the file
	/// extension can be passed to the framework in one of the following ways:
	/// <br /><br />
	/// <ol>
	/// <li><strong>Using the Application Configuration: </strong>It is possible to
	/// include a <em>baseconfig4net</em> section in the .NET application's
	/// configuration file, i.e., <strong>Web.config</strong> or
	/// <strong>App.config</strong>.  Information about the base location of
	/// <em>Configuration</em> files and file extension can be included under the
	/// <em>baseconfig4net</em> section as individual nodes.  The following
	/// example shows how to set the root configuration path to
	/// <em>C:\AppPath\Config</em> and file extension to <em>config</em> through
	/// the <strong>Web.config</strong> file:
	/// <br /><br />
	/// &lt;configuration&gt;<br />
	///	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;configSections&gt;<br />
	/// <strong>
	/// </strong>
	///	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/configSections&gt;<br />
	/// <strong>
	///	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;baseconfig4net&gt;<br />
	///	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;rootPath&gt;C:\AppPath\Config&lt;/rootPath&gt;<br />
	///	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;fileExtension&gt;config&lt;/fileExtension&gt;<br />
	///	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/baseconfig4net&gt;<br />
	/// </strong>
	///	&lt;/configuration&gt;
	/// </li>
	/// <li><strong>Using <em>System.Xml.XmlElement</em>: </strong>It is also
	/// possible to pass an <em>System.Xml.XmlElement</em> to the framework with
	/// the root node set as <em>baseconfig4net</em>.</li>
	/// <li><strong>Using <em>System.IO.Stream</em>: </strong>If a
	/// <em>System.Xml.XmlElement</em> is not available directly, a
	/// <em>System.IO.Stream</em> reference can be passed to the framework.  This
	/// reference should be for a valid XML string containing a <em>baseconfig4net</em>
	/// section.  It does not matter where the <em>baseconfig4net</em> element is in
	/// the XML string.</li>
	/// <li><strong>Using <em>System.IO.FileInfo</em>: </strong>The last possible
	/// way of configuring the framework is by passing a valid
	/// <em>System.IO.FileInfo</em> reference to it.  This reference should point to
	/// a valid XML file containing a <em>baseconfig4net</em> section.  It does not
	/// matter where the <em>baseconfig4net</em> element is in the XML file.</li>
